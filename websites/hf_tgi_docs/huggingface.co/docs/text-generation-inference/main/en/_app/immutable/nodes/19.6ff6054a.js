This results in attention operation having a memory bottleneck. <strong>Flash Attention</strong> is an attention algorithm used to reduce this problem and scale transformer-based models more efficiently, enabling faster training and inference.",M,c,q="Standard attention mechanism uses High Bandwidth Memory (HBM) to store, read and write keys, queries and values. HBM is large in memory, but slow in processing, meanwhile SRAM is smaller in memory, but faster in operations. In the standard attention implementation, the cost of loading and writing keys, queries, and values from HBM is high. It loads keys, queries, and values from HBM to GPU on-chip SRAM, performs a single step of the attention mechanism, writes it back to HBM, and repeats this for every single attention step. Instead, Flash Attention loads keys, queries, and values once, fuses the operations of the attention mechanism, and writes them back.",$,p,C='<img src="https://huggingface.co/datasets/huggingface/documentation-images/resolve/main/tgi/flash-attn.png" alt="Flash Attention"/>',x,f,F='It is implemented for supported models.
