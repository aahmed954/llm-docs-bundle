With multi-backend support, you can choose the backend that best suits your needs,
whether you prioritize performance, ease of use, or compatibility with specific hardware. API interaction with
TGI remains consistent across backends, allowing you to switch between them seamlessly.`,w,r,M="<strong>Supported backends:</strong>",T,l,P=`<li><strong>TGI CUDA backend</strong>: This high-performance backend is optimized for NVIDIA GPUs and serves as the default option
within TGI.
