Its purpose is to serve as a <strong>modular toolbox</strong> for both inference and training.`,X,w,He="We aim at building a library that stands the test of time and therefore take API design very seriously.",Z,v,De='In a nutshell, Diffusers is built to be a natural extension of PyTorch. Therefore, most of our design choices are based on <a href="https://pytorch.org/docs/stable/community/design.html#pytorch-design-philosophy" rel="nofollow">PyTorch‚Äôs Design Principles</a>. Let‚Äôs go over the most important ones:',ee,x,te,_,Ie='<li>While Diffusers has many built-in performance-enhancing features (see <a href="https://huggingface.co/docs/diffusers/optimization/fp16" rel="nofollow">Memory and Speed</a>), models are always loaded with the highest precision and lowest optimization. Therefore, by default diffusion pipelines are always instantiated on CPU with float32 precision if not otherwise defined by the user. This ensures usability across different platforms and accelerators and means that no complex installations are required to run the library.</li> <li>Diffusers aims to be a <strong>light-weight</strong> package and therefore has very few required dependencies, but many soft dependencies that can improve performance (such as <code>accelerate</code>, <code>safetensors</code>, <code>onnx</code>, etc‚Ä¶). We strive to keep the library as lightweight as possible so that it can be added without much concern as a dependency on other packages.</li> <li>Diffusers prefers simple, self-explainable code over condensed, magic code. This means that short-hand code syntaxes such as lambda functions, and advanced PyTorch operators are often not desired.</li>',ie,T,se,$,Se="As PyTorch states, <strong>explicit is better than implicit</strong> and <strong>simple is better than complex</strong>. This design philosophy is reflected in multiple parts of the library:",oe,k,Ue=`<li>We follow PyTorch‚Äôs API with methods like <a href="https://huggingface.co/docs/diffusers/main/en/api/diffusion_pipeline#diffusers.DiffusionPipeline.to" rel="nofollow"><code>DiffusionPipeline.to</code></a> to let the user handle device management.</li> <li>Raising concise error messages is preferred to silently correct erroneous input. Diffusers aims at teaching the user, rather than making the library as easy to use as possible.</li> <li>Complex model vs. scheduler logic is exposed instead of magically handled inside. Schedulers/Samplers are separated from diffusion models with minimal dependencies on each other. This forces the user to write the unrolled denoising loop. However, the separation allows for easier debugging and gives the user more control over adapting the denoising process or switching out diffusion models or schedulers.</li> <li>Separately trained components of the diffusion pipeline, <em>e.g.</em> the text encoder, the unet, and the variational autoencoder, each have their own model class. This forces the user to handle the interaction between the different model components, and the serialization format separates the model components into different files. However, this allows for easier debugging and customization. DreamBooth or Textual Inversion training
is very simple thanks to Diffusers‚Äô ability to separate single components of the diffusion pipeline.</li>`,ne,M,le,P,Ae=`For large parts of the library, Diffusers adopts an important design principle of the <a href="https://github.com/huggingface/transformers" rel="nofollow">Transformers library</a>, which is to prefer copy-pasted code over hasty abstractions. This design principle is very opinionated and stands in stark contrast to popular design principles such as <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Don%27t_repeat_yourself" rel="nofollow">Don‚Äôt repeat yourself (DRY)</a>.
In short, just like Transformers does for modeling files, Diffusers prefers to keep an extremely low level of abstraction and very self-contained code for pipelines and schedulers.
Functions, long code blocks, and even classes can be copied across multiple files which at first can look like a bad, sloppy design choice that makes the library unmaintainable.
<strong>However</strong>, this design has proven to be extremely successful for Transformers and makes a lot of sense for community-driven, open-source machine learning libraries because:`,ae,L,Ee="<li>Machine Learning is an extremely fast-moving field in which paradigms, model architectures, and algorithms are changing rapidly, which therefore makes it very difficult to define long-lasting code abstractions.</li> <li>Machine Learning practitioners like to be able to quickly tweak existing code for ideation and research and therefore prefer self-contained code over one that contains many abstractions.</li> <li>Open-source libraries rely on community contributions and therefore must build a library that is easy to contribute to. The more abstract the code, the more dependencies, the harder to read, and the harder to contribute to. Contributors simply stop contributing to very abstract libraries out of fear of breaking vital functionality. If contributing to a library cannot break other fundamental code, not only is it more inviting for potential new contributors, but it is also easier to review and contribute to multiple parts in parallel.</li>",re,C,je=`At Hugging Face, we call this design the <strong>single-file policy</strong> which means that almost all of the code of a certain class should be written in a single, self-contained file.
